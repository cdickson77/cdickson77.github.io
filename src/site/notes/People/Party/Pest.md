The cutest member of [[People/Party/The Party\|The Party]]
Appeared out of thin air in a poof of smoke, in place of [[People/Party/Dead or gone/Varyn Grimlance\|Varyn Grimlance]] who disappeared.
[[People/Party/Bjorn\|Bjorn]] believed it was [[People/Party/Pest\|Pest]] who placed the beartrap he was then set in, threatening to kill him for it.
In his first combat against some wolves, he managed to save [[People/Party/Bjorn\|Bjorn]], [[People/Party/Elias\|Elias]], and [[People/Party/Kenra\|Kenra]] when he got a lucky roll on Nathairs Mischief, causing the wolves to be incapacitated while [[People/Party/The Party\|The Party]] made a run for it.
