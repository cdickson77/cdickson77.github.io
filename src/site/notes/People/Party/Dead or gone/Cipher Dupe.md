Dead lmfao
Third of [[Dead or gone \|The Party]] to die.

Was lost in the mists around [[Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]] with [[People/Party/Dead or gone/Varyn Grimlance\|Varyn Grimlance]] and [[People/Party/Ffion\|Ffion]], until they finally found their way to the [[Locations/Village of Barovia/Village of Barovia\|Village of Barovia]], and meeting [[People/Party/Elte\|Elte]], [[People/Party/Jip Bip\|Jip Bip]], and [[People/Party/Kenra\|Kenra]].

Exploded into a fine mist.
