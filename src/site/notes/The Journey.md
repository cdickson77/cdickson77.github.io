Back on the trail up to [[Locations/Vallaki\|Vallaki]], [[People/Party/Bjorn\|Bjorn]], who is pulling the cart, begins to follow [[People/Raven Woman\|a raven]] down a side path, eventually finding a broken wagon, pools of blood, raven feathers, and one deep footprint. Eventually while investigating, the party hears footsteps approaching from behind, seeing a [[People/Raven Woman\|cloaked woman]], [[People/Party/Pest\|Pest]] can tell she is the raven they followed here. She says a bunch of creepy stuff, eventually letting [[People/Party/The Party\|The Party]] know the footprint by the wagon is from her failing to land correctly. She also explains the wagon is from [[People/The Martikovs\|The Martikovs]], down the path to the south-left. After being weird for a while, she leaves, saying "You didnt see me, you just heard a raven" (or something idk i have bad memory). Through investigating the wagon, [[People/Party/The Party\|The Party]] finds a bunch of wine bottles, all marked as from the [[Locations/Martikov Winery\|Martikov Winery]].
