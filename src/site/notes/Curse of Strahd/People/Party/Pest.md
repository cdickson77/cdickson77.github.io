The cutest member of [[Curse of Strahd/People/Party/The Party\|The Party]].
Bff of [[Curse of Strahd/People/Party/Spud\|Spud]].

Appeared out of thin air in a poof of smoke, in place of [[Curse of Strahd/People/Party/Dead or gone/Varyn Grimlance\|Varyn Grimlance]] who disappeared.
[[Curse of Strahd/People/Party/Bjorn\|Bjorn]] believed it was [[Curse of Strahd/People/Party/Pest\|Pest]] who placed the beartrap he was then set in, threatening to kill him for it.
In his first combat against some wolves, he managed to save [[Curse of Strahd/People/Party/Bjorn\|Bjorn]], [[Curse of Strahd/People/Party/Elias\|Elias]], and [[Curse of Strahd/People/Party/Kenra Whisper\|Kenra Whisper]] when he got a lucky roll on Nathairs Mischief, causing the wolves to be incapacitated while [[Curse of Strahd/People/Party/The Party\|The Party]] made a run for it. Due to this he has been unanimously voted as the best wizard to have ever lived.
