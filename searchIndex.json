Eventually while investigating, the party hears footsteps approaching from behind, seeing a <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/curse-of-strahd/people/raven-woman/\">cloaked woman</a>, <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/curse-of-strahd/people/party/pest/\">Pest</a> can tell she is the raven they followed here.
